# Bunny Project
## Bunnies
-At program initialization, 5 bunnies must be created and given random colours, age can be 0 or random between 0 and 9. 

-Each turn, the bunnies age 1 year. 

-As long as there is a male (aged 2 or older), for each female in the list (aged 2 or older) a new bunny is created each turn. (E.G. if there was 1 adult male and 3 adult females, three new bunnies would be born each turn) 

-New born bunnies should be the same colour as their mother. 

-If a bunny becomes older than 10 years old, it dies. 

-If an infected bunny is born, each turn it will change one normal bunny into a infected bunny (E.G. If there are two infected bunnies two bunnies will be changed each turn and so on...) 

-Infected bunnies are excluded from regular breeding and do not count as adult bunnies. 

-Infected do not die until they reach age 50. 

-Each turn, the program should print a list of all the bunnies in the colony with all the details, sorted by age. 

-The program should also output each turns events such as: Bunny Keith was born!  

-When all the bunnies have died the program terminates. 

-If the bunny population exceeds 1000 a food shortage must occur killing exactly half of the bunnies (randomly chosen) 

EXTRAS 

## 1  

Modify the program to run in real time, with each turn lasting 2 seconds, and a one second pause between each announcement. 

## 2  

Remove the population limit and see how many bunnies your program can handle  

Allow the user to hit the 'k' key to initiate a mass rabbit cull! which causes half of all the rabbits to be killed (randomly chosen).
